To build a system that works everywhere, one must consider service discovery, configuration management and network isolation right from the beginning.\nLet us a build production ready and automated data ingestion pipeline using docker. We will first build a simple python app that takes a csv and stores in a PostgreSQL database, then evolves into a multi-container architecture where a data-importer service automatically ingests data into a dedicated DBMS.\nFor this data pipeline, lets get Paris AirBnB Listings data and build that data importer app. This app will take this csv data and store it into a database inside the PostgreSQL container. To make this app usable for any data, we will parametrize all the input variables.\nThis app takes a CSV file and creates a URL object with parameterized connection details. In isolated environments, Docker’s DNS system resolves service names to container IPs automatically. Everything is parameterized for reuse."

This parsing process converts the input into Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This AST is called Unresolved Logical Plan.\n\n\nAnalysis\nThe Unresolved Logical Plan is validated for Table/Column names and data types by looking up into the catalog. It also resolves the attributes and binds to the actual schema. It also verifies the functions that is actually available. After Analyzer Rules Execution, this steps yields an entity known as Resolved Logical Plan\n\n\nLogical Optimization\nThe Resolved Logical Plan is then undergoes into a Rule-Based Optimization step. There are several rules that are applied here and some of the key optimization rules are\n\nPredicate Pushdown: This rule prepones the filter operation as early as possible in the query execution plan. The idea is to reduce the volume of data that flows in the operation as early as possible.\nCombine Filters: This rule combines similar filter operations into one.\nProjection Pruning: This rule selects only the required columns that are implicated in the query.\nNull Propagation: Optimize null checks\nConstant Propagation: if there is any computation involves using a constant, it is simplified at the beginning and not executed repeatedly through out the query execution.\n\nThe logical optimization steps yields Optimized Logical Plan\n\n\nPhysical Planning\nThe Optimized Logical Plan is then evaluated against a cost model for several alternative plans. The estimation of cost is projected based on\n\nData size\nComplexity of the operation\nNetwork shuffle cost\nResource requirements\n\nThe least expensive model is selected in this step and it is called Selected Physical Plan.\n\n\nCode Generation and execution\nThe selected physical plan is then taken as a base and an optimized code and the execution is then carried out as described in Essentials of Spark Architecture.\n\n\nVisualizing the Spark Optimization Steps\nThe selected physical plans can be read using df.explain() | df.explain(\"simple\") and all the steps of the optimization plan can be seen df.explain(\"extended\"). The generated code can be seen using df.explain(\"codegen\") and df.explain(\"cost\") can print the logical plan and statistics if they are available."

In spark, there are two types of operations. Transformations and actions. The DAG is comprised of these transformations and actions. The smallest sub unit of any operation is a task and a set of tasks are grouped in a stage. Spark DAG is built according to the logic of the user’s application. The logical DAG is broken down into stages and TaskScheduler serializes and assigns individual tasks. The Driver program stores the metadata of the tasks shared with the executors and the results are collected back once the tasks are completed. The taks lineage is readily available in the driver so that it can quickly rebuild a lost partition in case a failure. The process of building serialized stages is called DAG scheduling. The scheduled DAG stages are then transferred to Task Scheduler. TaskScheduler assigns tasks to executors. Actual execution happens only when an action is required, this is the so called ‘Lazy Evaluation’."

In SparkSession, along with SparkContext, SQL, Streaming, ML and Graph context are available and unified into one engine under the same SparkSession offering superior flexibility. SparkContext is now available as backward compatible to access low level RDD features. Since the higher level APIs are accessible with SparkSession, Apache recommends to initialize with SparkSession.\n\n\nSparkContext\nSparkContext is created by the driver program and this was formerly the entry point until spark 2.x.x. SparkContext connects to the cluster manager and acquires the required resources for the distributed computation. It then sends the serialized DAG stages to the executor nodes and keeps track of the execution via regular heart beat messages.\n\n\nCluster manager :\nThe computing resources are managed by the cluster manager. There are three different types of cluster management in Spark. Namely, Spark standalone, Kubernetes and YARN. Often the resource manager resides in master node but this depends on the deployment mode of the application. In local deployment mode, The driver and executor nodes are hosted in a single thread and spark manages the threads itself and no cluster manager is involved in this case.\nThe resource manager receives requests from the task scheduler and launches executor processes on the worker nodes. The executor process(es) are launched in pods (kubernetes), containers /raw processes (spark standalone) depending on the configuration of the deployment. It then pings back the availability of the worker nodes and a connection is established between the spark driver program and the worker nodes.\n\n\nExecutors\nThe executor manages the task execution and manages the memory, it communicates with the driver program to report the status of the assigned tasks and return the computed results. The executors are also involved in shuffle operations and act as a server for other executors to access the local data of the executor."

There are public API endpoints available and one should be able to pull the data in a python script. For example, one can use the following script to pull data from a public API (luckily this one is free and not rate-limited).\nThis script works perfectly in a local machine and saves the clean data into the destination of the pipeline. Great!\nBut challenge arises when you want to containerize your application. Yes using docker-compose.yml, one can create a bridge network and you can orchestrate the communication between containers. I have previously written about it here . But you might want to verify the image before you orchestrate and when you build the app image using Dockerfile, with the command docker build -t &lt;your-img-tag&gt; ., you will get the image be built without any problem. But when you run the app locally to verify it works as intended, you will get ConnectionError because the container is isolated from your local network.\nSo how does one solve this problem?\nThis is where --dns flag comes into play. you can simply instruct the image to resolve the ipaddress to a public server (such as google’s dns service) That single flag, --dns 8.8.8.8, instructs the container to use Google’s public DNS server for resolving hostnames."

Your script tries to resolve api.gold-api.com, fails, and throws a ConnectionError.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Docker’s Default DNS Behavior\nBy default, Docker containers use the host’s DNS settings. However, in some configurations (especially on Linux without systemd-resolved or with certain network managers), this inheritance breaks down.

It is a portrait of a French engineer who lived during the Napoleonic Era, woven entirely on silk.\n\n\n\nThe Most Famous Image in the Early History of Computing. This is actually a portrait of a silk fabric on which the image of Jacquard was woven. Portrait by Michel Marie Carquillat after Claude Bonnefond (circa 1839). Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\n\n\nJoseph Marie Jacquard was born in Lyon, France and was a weaver and master inventor. He was celebrated by the Emperor Napoleon for the invention of a “programmable loom”. Jacquard’s idea of using punched cards to represent where a thread must go up or down in fine silk fabric to produce motifs and patterns with unlimited resolution immediately became a royal sensation.\nCharles Babbage had not only personally possessed one of these portraits of Jacquard woven in silk using 24,000 punched cards, but was also deeply inspired by it. He adopted these very punched cards as the input device for his Analytical Engine.\nAfter all, transcribing a complex design onto fabric by controlling threads with punched cards is a physical demonstration of binary logic, waiting to be spotted by a visionary like Babbage. Later, IBM produced computers that used punched cards and card readers. Early computer programs were written on paper, translated into punched cards, then loaded into a computer to be read and executed.\nWait - why am I boring you with the history of computers?\nA couple of days ago, I saw a post in my feed where someone uploaded a photo to an LLM and asked it to return a pattern so his wife could knit the photo into socks or a handbag.\nIt was in that moment I saw the circle close. The punched cards of the 1800s have now evolved into artificial neural networks, only to give back a pattern showing where a thread must go up or down in a fabric.\n\n\n\nAI-generated representation of Joseph Marie Jacquard with a punched card\n\n\nI started my career as a textile engineer, and I still vividly remember creating punches in cardboard for the Jacquard loom using a piano card-punching machine during practical sessions. Fast forward to this day of writing, I am now living in Lyon and working at the intersection of informatics and complex data, still looking for patterns not on fabric but on data.\nI just had a moment of awe witnessing the threads of technology woven into a perfect circle across the fabric of space and time. This convergence felt deeply personal. It is a powerful reminder that technology often spirals upward instead of progressing linearly.\n\n\n\nAI-generated visual summary of this blog post.

To handle such big data, Hadoop had “Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)” framework and batch processing through the MapReduce function. These innovations enabled distributed computing to run on commodity hardware. While this offered many advantages such as partitioned data, distributed processing etc, significant challenges remained in terms of scalability and speed since it is based on disc. This is because this way of distributed processing resulted in exponential read write cycles for each intermediate steps.\nSpark was developed to address these important bottlenecks in terms of speed and efficiency by adopting “in-memory computing”.

    "text": "Apache Spark\nApache Spark was developed by Matei Zaharia of University of California, Berkeley in 2009 and was donated to Apache Software Foundation in 2013.\nSpark is a distributed computing framework that addressed bottlenecks in the traditional Hadoop based big data tools. Spark achieves performance improvement on the following fronts:\n\nIn-memory computing\nPartitioning\nFault-tolerant computing\nUnified engine for big data ecosystem\n\n\n\n\nApache Spark\n\n\n\nIn-memory computing:\nSpark works via in-memory computing that retains the data cached in the memory. This alone can yield 100-1000x speedups. Imagine a computation with many steps. At each step, the data must be read from the disk, loaded into memory (RAM), processed, intermediate results are written back. This operation must be repeated until the operation is completed. Clearly, the bottleneck is the repeated read, write cycle of intermediary data to hard disk. Spark eliminates most of this repetitive I/O on the disk by keeping the intermediate results in memory, dramatically accelerating performance. Spark intelligently manages the memory by keeping maximum of the partition data in memory (RAM). When the partition data exceeds the allocated in-memory, spark spills over the least frequently used partitions to the physical memory (disk) and quickly read back if and when the partition is needed.\n\n\nAbstractions in Spark\nSpark developed its core abstraction called Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD) in the 2010s followed by the now popular Dataset and DataFrame which are the latest (introduced 2015-2016) higher level API implementations of Spark. DataFrames and Datasets are the preferred APIs today for their optimizations and ease of use. The RDDs still remain functional and used for specialized use cases.\n\n\nData Partitioning:\nSpark partitions the data either by a variable in the data or arbitrarily by equal size. Partitioning by a variable of the data frame can be created using partitionby() method and arbitrary partitions can be created using repartition() method. Proper partitioning is critical for parallelism and optimized performance.\n\n\nFault-tolerant computing:\nSpark is fault tolerant since it can rapidly recreate the partition data on any failed nodes. Sparks tracks the lineage of the partition from the original data. If a node fails, spark rebuilds the lost data without ever stopping or restarting the process. This enabled horizontal scaling to handle petabytes of data reliably.\n\n\nSpark has an Unified Engine\nTraditional Hadoop based solutions relied on different independent frameworks for specific processing of the data. For example for bigdata processing, there was MapReduce, for Stream Processing there was Strom or Samza, for SQL queries there was Hive or Impala. These resulted in a data silos, complex architectures and expensive data overheads. This is because the engineers had to master many tools and integrate into their system. Spark has the core engine and has several higher level APIs such as Spark SQL, Structured Streaming, Spark MLlib and Spark Graphx for querying, real-time data processing, machine learning and graph analytics all unified in the Spark framework, making it a powerful modern data stack.\n\n\nSpark is Polyglot\nSpark’s core is written in Scala and APIs for Python (pyspark), Java, R (sparklyr) and SQL are available making it a powerful language across different data and statistical stacks. Spark documentation describes near identical performance across these languages.\n\n\nConclusion\nApache Spark revolutionized big data processing by providing a unified, in-memory computing framework that addressed the limitations of traditional Hadoop ecosystems. By combining in-memory processing, intelligent partitioning, fault tolerance, and a polyglot API approach, Spark delivers dramatic performance improvements while simplifying complex data architectures. Its ability to handle diverse workloads from batch processing and real-time streaming to machine learning and graph analytics makes it a powerful engine for today’s big data challanges. All these operations are efficiently performed through a single integrated engine makes it a cornerstone of modern data platforms. As data volumes continue to grow and processing demands become more complex, Spark’s balanced approach of performance, reliability, and developer accessibility ensures its enduring relevance in the data engineering landscape."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Back when I was working as a production engineer in India, the company had implemented the concept of “7S-System of House keeping”. The 7S is an extension of the Japanese philosophy of 5S. The 7S are: - Seiri - Sort the items - Seiton - A place for every item and every item in its place - Seiso - Remove unwanted items and arrange the necessary items in a ordely way - Seiketsu - Consistently apply the cleanling practice - Shitsuke - Train so that the sytem is maintained without explicit instructions - Shikkari - Stabilize / Standardize - Shitsukoku - Persistently maintain the system\nNow working in the domain of data, I often think about this philosophy and how intertwined it is with the data warehousing. Although the factory warehouse and Data warehouse different purposes, the fundamental actions are the same. A factory warehouse - receives inventory items from different providers, - inspects it for correctness, - ensures that no components are missing, - sorts and standardizes them, - stores them in a specific way and place for serving the end users. A Data warehouse follows the same logic. It receives incoming data either in batches or in real-time streams, the incoming data is handled in the staging area, for their correctness, missing values and normalization. Once they are compliant with the specification, the facts and dimensions are modelled and stored in appropriate tables in the database for the end users to consume.\nHere is a breakdown of how the 7S philosophy directly applies to a modern data warehouse: While there is an order for the 7S principles, they are not necessarily sequential. That is to say, it does not follow the same order as the data warehousung process. However, the principles are all relevant and can be applied at different stages of the data warehousing process."

    "text": "Seiketsu - Clean to achieve consistency\nThe Seiketsu principle emphasizes the importance of cleanliness and organization. In the context of data warehousing, this can be interpreted as the need for data cleansing and data quality management. Just like in a factory warehouse, where dirty or damaged items can cause problems, in a data warehouse, dirty or inaccurate data can cause problems for end users. This could be achieved through the use of data cleansing techniques such as data profiling, data validation, and data transformation, which help to ensure that the data is accurate and consistent. Additionally, it also emphasizes the importance of monitoring and maintaining the quality of the data over time, which helps to ensure that the data remains accurate and useful for end users."

In the context of data warehousing, this can be interpreted as the need for a well-designed data model and schema. Just like in a factory warehouse, where each item has a specific place, in a data warehouse, each piece of data should have a specific place in the database/ schema or even in table. This could be achieved through the use of dimensional modeling techniques such as star schema or snowflake schema, which help to organize the data in a way that is easy to understand and query. Additionally, it also emphasizes the importance of metadata management, which helps to ensure that the data is properly documented and can be easily understood by end users."

    "text": "Seiso - Stratification\nThe Seiso principle also emphasizes the importance of stratification, which is the process of organizing items into different layers or levels. In the context of data warehousing, this can be interpreted as the need for a well-designed data architecture that separates different types of data into different layers. For example, a common architecture for a data warehouse is to have a staging layer, where raw data is stored, a presentation layer, where cleaned and transformed data is stored, and a consumption layer, where data is made available for end users. It can also be compared to the popular medallion architecture, which separates data into bronze, silver, and gold layers.\nThis separation of layers helps to ensure that the data is properly organized and can be easily accessed by end users. While the Seiri and Seiton principles also emphasize the importance of organization, the Seiso principle specifically emphasizes the importance of stratification, that stratify the process with the operation layers in terms of architecture which is a crucial aspect of data warehousing."

In the context of data warehousing, this can be interpreted as the need for a well-trained team that is familiar with the data warehousing process and the tools and technologies used to build and maintain the data warehouse. This could be achieved through regular training sessions, workshops, and knowledge sharing among team members. Additionally, it also emphasizes the importance of fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous learning within the team, which helps to ensure that the team is able to adapt to changes in technology and business requirements over time."

In the context of data warehousing, this can be interpreted as the need for a well-designed data warehousing architecture that is scalable, reliable, and maintainable. Notably, the data engineers must build the data warehouses that ensures resillience by anticipating potential issues and implementing appropriate measures to mitigate them. For example, this could include a systematic approach to data backup and recovery, version control for data and code,and proactive technical debt management.\nBy adopting a datawarehouse design based on the 7S philosopy, data engineers can build, operate and maintain a sustainable, high-quality and well-governed data warehouse that serves the needs of the business and end users effectively. The 7S principles provide a holistic framework for thinking about the various aspects of data warehousing, from data quality and organization to team culture and architecture."
